<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Edin Snopche, a passionate kitchen worker at Lounge Bar Liquid Gositvar. I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can work with my hands and create something people enjoy. Cooking has always been more than just a job to me — it’s a way to express creativity, experiment with flavors, and make people smile.</p>
<p>When I’m in the kitchen, I focus on every detail, from prepping ingredients to presenting dishes beautifully. Working closely with my amazing team, led by my boss Beli, who I admire deeply, I’m constantly learning and perfecting my craft. Beli’s guidance has shaped my journey, and I’m grateful to work with such a strong leader.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new recipes and staying updated on culinary trends. Whether it’s learning how to cook a new dish or tweaking a recipe to make it my own, I’m always looking for ways to expand my skills. In my downtime, you’ll find me experimenting in my own kitchen or diving into the latest food-related content online.</p>
